> instead Adversarial training, this blog implements gaussian distribution as prior (similar to VAE). worth a try.

## sample result

after training 100 epochs with `Adam(lr=1e-4)`, we see that the encoder is able to distinguish "animals" and non-living things. (among 100 test images)
> top row : selected image; middle row : top 10 images with smallest L1 loss; bottom row : top 10 images with largest L1 loss.
